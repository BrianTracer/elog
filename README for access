Here are some tips:

1.If you are in the RPC lab : 
 Connecting to the wifi "RPClab" ,then open the document and input "\\RPClab"
 The wifi code is:   RPClab2018

2.If you are outside(not in the lab but in SJTU):
 Make sure you have connecting the "SJTU" (the inner web of sjtu)
 Then you can open the document and input "ftp://202.120.13.50"
 Input the user name: User   , the code is : RPC2018

3.If you are outside(not in sjtu)
    FIRST, setup the SJTU VPN (if you don't know how to acquire the sjtu VPN, visiting this websetite: https://net.sjtu.edu.cn/wlfw/VPN.htm)
    Then you can open the document and input "ftp://202.120.13.50"
    After that,Input the user name and code is OK
