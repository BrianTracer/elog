<div class=Sub><i>Global and individual logbook options for an ELOG server</i></div>

<hr>
<p>
The configuration file <b><code>elogd.cfg</code></b> contains entries which define
the structure of logbooks and the behaviour of <code><b>elogd</b></code>. The file has a simple ASCII
format. Each logbook is defined by a <b><code>[&lt;name&gt;]</code></b> section
where &lt;name&gt; is the name of the logbook. The <b><code>[global]</code></b>
section is used for settings common to all logbooks. Each line contains a setting
name, followed by an equal sign and the value for this setting. Lines starting with
";" are treated as comments.
<p>
Here is a simple example, which define two logbooks, "<I>Linux</I>" and "<I>PC</I>":
<p>
<ul><pre>
[global]
Logbook tabs = 1
SMTP host = mailsend.your.domain

[Linux]
Theme = default
Comment = General linux tips and tricks
Attributes = Author, Type, Category, Subject
Options Type = Routine, Software Installation, Problem Fixed, Configuration, Other
Options Category = General, Hardware, Software, Network, Account, Other
Options Author = Stefan, Linus, unknown
Required Attributes = Author

[PC]
Comment = Database PC installations
Attributes = Location, OS, Owner
Options Location = Building1, Building2
Options OS = Linux, Windows ME, Windows 2000
Required Attributes = Location, Owner
Email All = name@address, othername@otheraddress
Use Mail Subject = Location
</pre></ul>
<p>

<a name="global"><hr>
<div class=title>&nbsp; Global options &nbsp;</div>
<p>
The notation of the following options is such that items enclosed by <b>"&lt;"</b> and <b>"&gt;"</b>
should be replaced by a specific string. If a value contains blanks (like a complete sentence), it
should <b>not</b> be enclosed in quotation marks.<p>

If a setting has a number of possible options, they are shown in the form
<code><b>option1|option2|...</b></code>, meaning that one of the options (without any vertical bar)
should be used.

The following options are specific to the <b><code>[global]</code></b> section:
<p>
<UL>

<LI><b><code>Port = &lt;port&gt;</code></b>
<br>
Specifies the TCP port under which the server is listening. Default is 80. Can be superseeded
via the '-p' command line flag.
<p>

<LI><b><code>Resource dir = &lt;directory&gt;</code></b>
<br>
Specifies the root directory for ELOG resources like help files, themes, icons and user HTML
files. Can be overwritten with the <b><code>-s</code></b> flag when starting elogd. If not
specified, use the directory where the configuration file <b><code>elogd.cfg</code></b> resides.
<i>Changing this option requires a restart of the elogd server</i>.
<p>

<LI><b><code>Logbook dir = &lt;directory&gt;</code></b>
<br>
Specifies the root directory for logbooks. Can be overwritten with the <b><code>-d</code></b> flag when
starting elogd. If not specified, use the directory where the configuration file <b><code>elogd.cfg
</code></b> resides. Each logbook data is stored in a separate directory under this root directory
specified by the <b><code>Subdir</b></code> option.
<i>Changing this option requires a restart of the elogd server</i>.
<p>

<LI><b><code>Language = &lt;name&gt;</code></b>
<br>

The language setting determines the language of the <code><b>elogd</b></code> output. Not
affected by this setting are the configuration file options and the commands specified with the
optional <code><b>Menu commands</b></code> and <code><b>Find menu commands</b></code>, which
have to be specified in English and are translated automatically by elogd. The attribute names
are unaffected by the language setting and have to be translated manually.<br><br>

If a language name is given (currently "<I>german</I>", "<I>french</I>", "<I>spanish</I>",
"<I>dutch</I>", "<I>brazilian</I>" are supported out-of-the-box),
the system searches for a file named <b>eloglang.&lt;name&gt;</b> containing
string translations from English into that language. <i>If you create a new translation file,
please send it back to the author to be included in future distributions</i>.
<br><br>

The online help for <code><b>elogd</b></code> is contained in the file <b>eloghelp_<i>xx</i>.html</b> where
<i>xx</i> are the first two letters of the language (like "<I>en</I>", "<I>ge</I>" and "<I>fr</I>"). For new languages, a new file of that type must be created as well.
<p>

<LI><b><code>charset = &lt;name&gt;</code></b>
<br>
Specifies the charset of the pages produced by <b><code>elogd</b></code>. Can be used to switch to
Russian or Asian fonts.
<p>

<LI><b><code>Logbook Tabs = [0|1]</code></b>
<br>
This flag controls the display of "<I>tabs</I>" on top of the logbook page which
allow to quickly switch between logbooks.
<p>

<LI><b><code>Main Tab = &lt;string&gt;</code></b>
<br>
If this option is present, an additional first tab is displayed which takes you back
to the main logbook selection page. The <b><code>string</b></code> is used for the
contents of the tab.
<p>

<LI><b><code>Welcome Title = &lt;html code&gt;</code></b>
<br>
This optional HTML code gets displayed in the title of the logbook selection
page. It can contain images via <b><code>&lt;img src="welcome.gif"&gt;</code></b>.
These images must be stored in the resource directory.
Alternatively, an absolute path can be used if the file name starts with a
<b><code>"/"</code></b> (Unix) or <b><code>"\"</code></b> or <b><code>"x:"</code></b>
(Windows).<br><br>

The following line is an example Welcome Title:<br>
<br>
<pre>Welcome title = &lt;img src="welcome.jpg"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size=5 color=white&gt;Welcome to our Elog&lt;/font&gt;</pre>
<br>
This displays an image and a text below.
<p>

<LI><b><code>Page title = &lt;string&gt;</code></b>
<br>
The string specified here is used for the title of individual logbook pages. It is also
used by most browsers for bookmark names. &lt;string&gt; can contain substitutions
like $&lt;attribute&gt; where &lt;attribute&gt; gets replaced by the attribute string
from each message. The option <b><code>Page title</code></b> in the <b><code>[global]</code></b>
section is used for the logbook selection page.
<p>

<LI><b><code>Summary page title = &lt;string&gt;</code></b>
<br>
The same for the summary or find result page. This may include substitutions as well, although
attribute substitutions make no sense here, since the summary page may contain many messages
with different attributes.
<p>

<LI><b><code>Selection page = &lt;file&gt;</code></b>
<br>
When this option is present, a user defined file is displayed instead of the logbook
selection page. This file must be stored in the resource directory. Alternatively, an
absolute path can be used if the file name starts with a
<b><code>"/"</code></b> (Unix) or <b><code>"\"</code></b> or <b><code>"x:"</code></b>
(Windows).<br><br>

It can be completely customized in order to contain logos etc. As a template,
the standard selection page produced by <code><b>elogd</b></code> can be used.
<p>

<LI><b><code>SMTP host = &lt;host.domain&gt;</code></b>
<br>
This defines the SMTP host needed to send automatic email notifications. The host
name you can get from your email program or your local system administrator.
<p>

<LI><b><code>Logfile = &lt;file&gt;</code></b>
<br>
This option specifies a filename which logs all login/logout activities and
successful user connections for logbooks with user level access.<p>

<LI><b><code>URL = &lt;http[s]://host.domain[:port]/[subdir/]&gt;</code></b>
<br>
If one of the three cases is true:<P>
<UL>
<LI><code><b>elogd</b></code> runs with <i>stunnel</i>
<LI><code><b>elogd</b></code> runs under a proxy
<LI>The automatic email notifications contains the wrong URL
</UL><p>

then the URL under which <code><b>elogd</b></code> is running has to be specified
manually with this statement. The URL has to
contain the port number if not the standard port 80 is used, it has to specify <i>https://</i>
if used under <i>stunnel</i>, and it has to contain the directory if used under a proxy like<br>
<br>
<table border=0 cellpadding=10>
<tr><td><code>URL = http://host.domain:8080/</code>   <td>if running on port 8080</tr>
<tr><td><code>URL = https://host.domain/</code>       <td>if running under <i>stunnel</i></tr>
<tr><td><code>URL = http://host.domain/subdir/</code> <td>if running under a proxy</tr>
</table>
<p>

<LI><b><code>Usr = &lt;name&gt;</code></b>
<LI><b><code>Grp = &lt;name&gt;</code></b>
<br>
The user and group to run the elogd daemon under when started by root.<p>

</UL>

<hr>
<div class=section>&nbsp; Groups of logbooks &nbsp;</div>
<p>

If installations have very many logbooks, it can be hard to navigate between them.
To make things more structured, it is possible to build a hierarchy of logbooks. A
logbook group can contain any number of logbooks as well as other logbook groups.
The hierarchy is defined with the the option<p>

<b><code>Group &lt;group name&gt; = &lt;Logbook1&gt;, &lt;Logbook2&gt;, &lt;other group&gt;</b></code><p>

in the <b><code>[global]</code></b> section of the configuration file.<p>

To define following logbook hierarchy:<p>

<img src="hierarchy.gif"><p>

one would use following statements:

<ul><pre>
[global]
Group Linux PCs = Red Hat, Debian, Mandrake
Group Windows PCs = 98, ME, NT, XP, CE
Group CE = 1.0, 2.0
</pre></ul>

The logbook tabs would then look like this:<p>

<img src="tabs.gif"><p>

Where the selected group or logbook becomes blue. The lower groups/logbooks change according
to the selected upper group. Please note that a logbook can be contained in more than one
group, but then it should not be the first logbook in those groups. The colors of the tabs
and the title bar can be specified in the CSS file.<p>

<hr>
<div class=title>&nbsp; Individual logbook options &nbsp;</div>
<p>
For each logbook, there is a section with the logbook name in square brackets, so that each
logbook can have different options. If an option is not present in a logbook section, then the
system tries to locate that option in the <code><b>[global]</b></code> section. Thus if the
following options are placed in the <code><b>[global]</b></code> section, they are defaults for
all logbooks. If they are present in the <code><b>[global]</b></code> and in the logbook
section, the logbook option is used.<p >

Here are the available options, by broad categories:<p>

<a name="general"><hr>
<div class=section>&nbsp; General options &nbsp;</div>

<UL>

<LI><b><code>Data dir = &lt;directory&gt;</code></b>
<br>
This option is obsolete from version 2.2.5 on and should not be used. Use <b><code>Subdir = ...</b></code>
instead.<p>

<LI><b><code>Subdir = &lt;directory&gt;</code></b>
<br>
Each logbook has a separate directory where the logbook entries are stored, which
is controlled by this statement. If the directory does not exist, it is created
autmatically by the <code><b>elogd</b></code> program. The subdirectory is relative
to the logbook root directory specified with the <b><code>Logbook dir = ...</code></b>
option. So if <b><code>Logbook dir = /usr/local/elog/logbooks</b></code> and
<b><code>Subdir = Demo</b></code> then the logbook data is stored in <b><code>
/user/local/elog/logbooks/Demo</b></code>. If the <b><code>Logbook dir = ...</code></b>
option is not specified, then <b><code>logbooks</code></b> is used. If the subdirectory
starts with a "/" ("\" under Windows), then it is used as an absolute path independent
of the logbook dir. To see which directories are used, start <b><code>elogd</b></code> with the "-v" flag.
<p>

<LI><b><code>Comment = &lt;comment&gt;</code></b>
<br>
The comment is displayed on the logbook selection list. The selection list is
displayed if more than one logbook is defined on a host and no logbook is
explicitly specified in the URL.
<p>

<LI><b><code>Theme = &lt;theme&gt;</code></b>
<br>
A theme determines which layout and colors are used for a logbook, similar to
<i>skins</i> in other programs. The <i>theme</i> option points to a subdirectory
under the <i>"themes"</i> directory which resides in the resource directory.
It contains all files for that theme. The format of these files is described under
the <i>Themes</i> section.
<p>

<LI><b><code>CSS = &lt;filename&gt;</code></b>
<br>
A given theme can contain several Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). This can be usefule
if several logbooks use the same images and icons, but differnt colors. By default,
the CSS <i>default.css</i> is used. This can be overwritten by this statement.
<p>

<LI><b><code>Title image URL = &lt;URL&gt;</code></b>
<br>
The ELOG icon at the right upper corner usually points to the ELOG home page. This
URL can be changed to point to a corporate page for example with this option. The
icon can be changed by replacing the <b><code>elog.gif</code></b> icon in the
theme directory.
<p>

<LI><b><code>Date format = &lt;string&gt;</code></b>
<br>
This option determines how the date of a logbook entry is displayed. The format
of the string is the same as the C function
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/manual/glibc-2.2.3/html_node/libc_427.html#IDX2636">
strftime</a>, so a string of <b>%A, %B %d, %Y</b> yields in a display of
<b>Thursday, November 15, 2001</b> for example.
<p>

<LI><b><code>Welcome Page = &lt;file&gt;</code></b>
<br>
By default, the list with the last twenty entries of a logbook is displayed when the logbook is selected.
This can be overridden with this option, which causes a HTML file to be shown
instead of the message list. This file can contain further links for new logbook
messages of for logbook queries. Here is a simple example of such a file:
<p>
<pre>
&lt;h1&gt;Welcome to the test logbook&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="?cmd=new"&gt;Enter&lt;/a&gt; a new message
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="?cmd=find"&gt;Search&lt;/a&gt; the logbook
&lt;/ul&gt;
</pre>

The file must be present in the resource directory.
Alternatively, an absolute path can be used if the file name starts with a
<b><code>"/"</code></b> (Unix) or <b><code>"\"</code></b> or <b><code>"x:"</code></b>
(Windows).
<p>

<LI><b><code>Start page = &lt;command&gt;</code></b>
<br>
This option can be used to display a different start page. <b><code>command</code></b>
can be either <i>0?cmd=Last</i> to display the last message, or any other ELog menu command in the
form <b><code>?cmd=xxx</code></b>. To start with the search page, one uses<p>

<pre>
Start page = ?cmd=Find
</pre>

Please note that if another language than English is selected via the <b>Language = xxx</b> option,
the commands have to be in that language as well (like <i>"Start page = 0?cmd=Letzter"</i> for
German).<p>

<LI><b><code>Submit Page = &lt;file&gt;</code></b>
<br>
This optional page can be displayed when a new message was submitted in a logbook.
Here is an example:
<p>
<pre>
&lt;h1&gt;You successfully submitted a message&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;a href="?cmd=Back"&gt;Back&lt;/a&gt; to the logbook&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="?cmd=New"&gt;Enter&lt;/a&gt; another message
</pre>

The file must be present in the resource directory.
Alternatively, an absolute path can be used if the file name starts with a
<b><code>"/"</code></b> (Unix) or <b><code>"\"</code></b> or <b><code>"x:"</code></b>
(Windows).
<p>

<li><b><code>Message comment = &lt;comment&gt;</code></b>
</br>
This optional comment is displayed on top of the text entry field when submitting
a new message. It can contain a sentence like "<I>Please enter your message here</I>:".
<p>

<li><b><code>Attachment comment = &lt;comment&gt;</code></b>
</br>
This optional comment is displayed on top of the attachment sumbission section when entering
a new message. It can contain a sentence like "<I>Please upload your attachments here</I>:".
<p>

<li><b><code>Menu commands = &lt;list&gt;</code></b>
</br>
This option specifies the menu commands displayed on top of a single logbook page. For
certain installations, it can be useful to disable some commands. Following
commands are possible:
<p>
  <ul>
  <li><b>New</b> - Enter new logbook entry
  <li><b>Edit</b> - Edit current logbook entry
  <li><b>Delete</b> - Delete current logbook entry
  <li><b>Reply</b> - Submit a reply to current entry
  <li><b>Download</b> - Download a message in ASCII format
  <li><b>Find</b> - Search entries in logbooks
  <li><b>Last day</b> - Display entries from last day
  <li><b>Move to</b> - Move entry to other logbook
  <li><b>Copy to</b> - Copy entry to other logbook
  <li><b>Config</b> - Edit elogd.cfg (if <b>no</b> "<I>Password file</I>" is given)
  <li><b>Config</b> - Modify/Add user accounts (if "<I>Password file</I>" is given)
  <li><b>Admin</b> - Edit elogd.cfg (if "<I>Password file</I>" is given)
  <li><b>Login</b> - Login with user name and password (if "<I>Password file</I>" is given)
  <li><b>Logout</b> - Logout current user (if "<I>Password file</I>" is given)

  <li><b>Help</b> - General help
  </ul>
<br><br>
The commands are always in English, independent of the <code><b>lanugae = ...</b></code>
setting, and are automatically translated into the specified language.<br><br>

If this option is not present, following default is used:
<br>
<pre>Menu commands = Back, New, Edit, Delete, Reply, Find, Config, Help</pre>
<br>

<li><b><code>Copy to = &lt;logbook list&gt;</code></b>
<li><b><code>Move to = &lt;logbook list&gt;</code></b>
<br>
The commands <code><b>Copy to</b></code> and <code><b>Move to</b></code> make it possible
to copy or move a logbook entry from one logbook to another. By default, all logbooks except
the current logbook are shown as a possible destination. With the configurations options
<b><code>Copy to = &lt;logbook list&gt;</code></b> and <b><code>Move to = &lt;logbook list&gt;</code></b>
it is possible to specify a list of destination logbooks, separated by commata. This can
make sense if only certain logbooks make sense as destinations.<p>

<li><b><code>Find Menu commands = &lt;list&gt;</code></b>
<br>
This option specifies the menu commands displayed on top of the listing page.
Although all commands from a above are possible,
only the commands <code><b>New, Find, Select, Config, Admin, Change
password, Logout</b></code> and <code><b>Help</b></code> make sense. The command <code><b>
Select</b></code> can be used to select multiple messages for deletion of moving to other
logbooks.<p>

<li><b><code>Guest Menu commands = &lt;list&gt;</code></b>
</br>
This option specifies the menu commands for guest logins. A guest login happens if a
password file is used, but someone accesses the logbook for the first time, which means
that no username/password is given. In that case the commands from the guest menu
are displayed, which usually contain a subset of the normal commands. A typical scenario
is a logbook which only has commands to read the logbook on the guest menu, but no
commands to write/edit entries. Instead, the <b>login</b> command is given in the guest
menu, with which one can login as a real user (username and password have to match those
from the password file), which then allowes full access via the <b>"Menu commands"</b> list.
A typical example for the menu settings for this scenario are:<p>
<pre>
Menu commands = Back, New, Edit, Reply, Find, Config, Logout, Help
Guest menu commands = Back, Find, Login, Help
</pre>
<p>
Note that the presence of this option opens user access also to the find result or elog
listing page, which usually contains some config command. So it is useful to combine
the <b><code>Guest menu commands</b></code> option with the following
<b><code>Guest Find Menu commands</b></code> option to restrict the access to the
find result page as well.
<p>

<li><b><code>Guest Find Menu commands = &lt;list&gt;</code></b>
</br>
Same as <b>Guest Menu commands</b> but for the find result page.<p>

<li><b><code>Menu text = &lt;file&gt;</code></b>
</br>
If this option is present, and additional menu row above the message gets displayed with
the contents of &lt;file&gt;. This file can contain arbitrary text, images or links.
One example would be following text to go back to the listing page and display the
next <i>Routine</i> entry and all <i>Routine</i> entries:<br>

<pre>
&lt;small&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="?cmd=next&type=Routine"&gt;Next Routine entry&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;|
&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="../?Type=Routine"&gt;All Routine entries&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/small&gt;
</pre>

<li><b><code>Find Menu text = &lt;file&gt;</code></b>
</br>
The same for the find result page. One example would be following text to
switch between the different display modi:<br>

<pre>
&lt;small&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="?mode=summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;|
&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="?mode=full"&gt;Full&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;|
&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="?mode=threaded"&gt;Threaded&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;|
&lt;/small&gt;
</pre>

<li><b><code>Bottom text = &lt;file&gt;</code></b>
</br>
If this option is present, the HTML contents of <b><code>file</code></b> is displayed at
the bottom of an Elog page instead of the little Elog home page link. It can contain for
example a link back to the main logbook selection page like:

<pre>
&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="/"&gt;Main page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
</pre>

Or it can contain other useful links. The file must be present in the resource directory.
Alternatively, an absolute path can be used if the file
name starts with a <b><code>"/"</code></b> (Unix) or <b><code>"\"</code></b> or <b><code>
"x:"</code></b> (Windows).

<p>

<li><b><code>Help URL = &lt;URL&gt;</code></b>

<br>
This URL is used for the Help button. By default, the file <b>eloghelp_xx.html</b> is returned with
the contents of the help page. Edit this file directly to add site-specific help for all logbooks.
Alternatively, use the <b><code>Help URL</code></b> option to specify different help pages for different
logbooks. It can point to a site-specific help page via <b><code>http://...</code></b> or to a local
file like <b><code>file://c:/tmp/config.html</code></b>, or to the name of an HTML file which must be
present in the resource directory. <p>

<li><b><code>Message Width = &lt;number&gt;</code></b>
<br>
This value sets the number of characters per line of the main message entry field.
The default value is 76 (78 for replies), and can be increased for installations
which need a larger window size (like pasting log files etc.).
<p>

<li><b><code>Message Height = &lt;number&gt;</code></b>
<br>
This value sets the number of lines of the main message entry field.
The default value is 20, and can be changed for installations
which need a different window size.
<p>

<li><b><code>Admin textarea = &lt;cols&gt;,&lt;rows&gt;</code></b>
<br>
This defines the textarea size for the admin page. Default is <b>80,40</b>.
<p>

<li><b><code>Display mode = [full|summary|threaded]</code></b>
<br>
Default mode for search display. On the find entry form, the checkboxes
are set accordingly. The "Last xxx" page uses this setting directly.
<p>

<li><b><code>Entries per page = &lt;number&gt;</code></b>
<br>
Number of logbook entries displayed per page in a search result. The default is 20.
<p>

</UL>

<a name="attrib"><hr>
<div class=section>&nbsp; Attributes &nbsp;</div>

<UL>
<LI><b><code>Attributes = &lt;list&gt;</code></b>
<br>
Define a number of attributes for the logbook. A maximum of 20 attributes can be
defined. Typical values are "<I>Author</I>", "<I>Subject</I>" or "<I>Type</I>".
<p>

<LI><b><code>Options &lt;attribute&gt; = &lt;list&gt;</code></b>
<br>
Usually, an text field is used for an attribute, where the user can fill in
text of up to 100 characters. If instead a drop-down box with preset items is
better for a given attribute, these items can be defined with this statement.
Up to 100 items can be defined, separated by commas. To add an option including
a comma, encose it in quotations marks like<p>
<pre>
Options town = San Francisco, "Paris, Texas", "Paris, France"
</pre>
<p>

<LI><b><code>ROptions &lt;attribute&gt; = &lt;list&gt;</code></b>
<br>
Same as <code><b>Options</b></code> above, but using radio buttons instead
of a drop-down box.
<p>

<LI><b><code>MOptions &lt;attribute&gt; = &lt;list&gt;</code></b>
<br>
This list allows for "<I>Multiple Options</I>", meaning that an attribute can have
several values simultaneously. When entering an entry with MOptions, each value
from the list is represented by a checkbox. Unlike with normal options, multiple
checkboxes can be checked for an entry. The attribue value then becomes
<p>
<pre>
&lt;value1&gt; | &lt;value2&gt; | ...
</pre>
In the "<I>find</I>" page only one of these values can be specified, which is then
treated as a substring in the search filter.
<p>

<LI><b><code>IOptions &lt;attribute&gt; = &lt;list&gt;</code></b>
<br>
This list specifies a set of icons for an attribute. Some icons are contained in
the <i>themes/default/icons</i> directory which can be used here like
<p>
<pre>
Attributes = Author, Icon, Subject...
IOptions Icon = icon1.gif, icon2.gif, icon3.gif, ...
</pre>
New icons are welcome and should be sent back to the author to be incorporated
in the next version.
<p>

<LI><b><code>Icon comment &lt;icon&gt; = &lt;comment&gt;</code></b>
<br>
Icons may contain a comment, which is then used in email notifications instead
of the icon file name. One has to add a separate icon comment for each icon file.
<p>

<LI><b><code>Options &lt;attribute&gt; = boolean</code></b>
<br>
If an attribute is marked "<I>boolean</I>" this way, a checkbox is displayed for
this attribute.
<p>

<LI><b><code>Preset &lt;attribute&gt; = &lt;string&gt;</code></b>
<br>
This option uses a preset string for an attribute. The string can contain
subsitutions like the ones described under the "<I>Subst &lt;attribute&gt;</I>"
command. One possible application is to use the login name for the author
field like:
<p>
<pre>
Preset Author = $long_name
</pre>
If the attribute should be locked at the Web submission, use the
"<I>Locked Attributes = ...</I>" option. If a preset value is given for an
attribute which has an options list, the preset value is selected in the drop
down box by default.
<p>

<LI><b><code>Preset text = &lt;string&gt; or &lt;file&gt;</code></b>
<br>
This preset value is used for the main body text. It can be a string or a file,
which must be present in the resource  directory.
Alternatively, an absolute path can be used if the file name starts with a
<b><code>"/"</code></b> (Unix) or <b><code>"\"</code></b> or <b><code>"x:"</code></b>
(Windows).
<p>

<LI><b><code>Locked Attributes = &lt;list&gt;</code></b>
<br>
The attributes specified here cannot be modified when a new entry is submitted.
This makes only sense for preset attributes.
<p>

<LI><b><code>Fixed Attributes Edit = &lt;list&gt;</code></b>
<br>
The attributes specified here cannot be modified when an existing entry
is modified via the <b><code>Edit</code></b> button. This feature can be
useful to preserve the original author of the message, when using the
<b><code>Preset Author = $long_name</code></b> option as described above.
<p>

<LI><b><code>Fixed Attributes Reply = &lt;list&gt;</code></b>
<br>
The attributes specified here cannot be modified when an existing entry
is replied on via the <b><code>Reply</code></b> button. This feature can be
useful to preserve the original subject of a message for example.
<p>

<LI><b><code>Required Attributes = &lt;list&gt;</code></b>
<br>
The attributes specified here are required when a new entry is submitted. The
attribute names are marked with <font color=red>*</font> on the entry form.
<p>

<LI><b><code>Page title = &lt;string&gt;</code></b>
<br>
The string specified here is used for the title of the web page. It is also
used by most browsers for bookmark names. The string can contain substitutions
as described unter the "<I>Subst &lt;attribute&gt;</I>" option.
<p>

<LI><b><code>Display search = &lt;list&gt;</code></b>
<br>
Specified the display and order of items in a search result page. In addition
to all attributes, one can specify here <b>"ID"</b> for the message ID, <b>"Logbook"</b>
and <b>"Date"</b>. The restriction to certain attributes can be helpful if many
attributes are defined in a logbook, which usually makes the table too big to
fit in the browser. The default
is<br>
<pre>
Display search = ID, Date, &lt;all attributs&gt;
</pre>
Which displays the message number, date, and all attributes. The display of the
message body is controlled by the <b><code>Display mode</code></b> and
<b><code>Summary lines</code></b> options.
<p>

<LI><b><code>Thread display = &lt;string&gt;</code></b>
<br>
Optional way to specify the line contents in the threaded search result. Following
substitutions are possible:
<p>
<UL>
<LI><b>$&lt;attribute&gt;</b>: The value of the attribute
<LI><b>$logbook</b>: The name of the current logbook
<LI><b>$entry date</b>: The message date, formatted via "<I>Date format</I>"
<LI><b>$message id</b>: The message ID
</UL>
<br>
A typical example would be
<br>
<pre>Thread display = $subject, posted by $author on $entry date</pre>
<p>

<LI><b><code>Thread icon = &lt;attribute&gt;</code></b>
<br>
If a logbook uses some icons for an attribute, these icons can be displayed
in the search result page instead of the default icons contained in the themes directory.
<p>

<LI><b><code>Subst &lt;attribute&gt; = &lt;string&gt;</code></b>
<br>
When submitting logbook entries, attribute values can be substituted by some
text. This text can contain arbitrary fixed text and following values:
<p>
<UL>
<LI><b>$&lt;attribute&gt;</b>: The entered value of the attribute itself
<LI><b>$host</b>: The host name where <code><b>elogd</b></code> is running
<LI><b>$remote_host</b>: The host name of the host from with the entry was submitted
<LI><b>$short_name</b>: The login name (if password file is present)
<LI><b>$long_name</b>: The full name from the password file for the current user
<LI><b>$user_email</b>: The email address from the password file for the current user
<LI><b>$logbook</b>: The name of the current logbook
<LI><b>$date</b>: The current date, formatted via "<I>Date format</I>"
</UL>
<br>
Following example use this feature to add the remote host name to the author:
<br>
<pre>Subst Author = $author from $remote_host</pre>
<p>

<LI><b><code>Remove on reply = &lt;list&gt;</code></b>
<br>
This option clears one or more (separated by commata) attribute values from a logbook
entry when creating a reply to that entry. This can make sense for example for
the author, since the author of a reply can be different from the original author.
<p>

<LI><b><code>Quote on reply = 0 | 1</code></b>
<br>
This flag controls if the original text is quoted in a reply. Default is <b>1</b>
<p>

<LI><b><code>Reply string = &lt;string&gt;</code></b>
<br>
String used to mark original message lines. Default is <b><code>"> "</code></b>. Can
be empty string ("") if no message marking is desired.
<p>

<LI><b><code>Subst on reply &lt;attribute &gt; = &lt;string&gt;</code></b>
<br>
Substitution of attributes for replies. This option can be used to replace the current
subject with a "Re: &lt;old subject&gt;":<br>
<pre>Subst on reply subject = Re: $subject</pre>
<p>

<LI><b><code>Subst on edit &lt;attribute &gt; = &lt;string&gt;</code></b>
<br>
Substitution of attributes for edited messages. This option can be used to replace the
author by the current author for example:<br>
<pre>Subst on edit author = $full_name</pre>
<p>

<LI><b><code>Quick filter = &lt;list&gt;</code></b>
<br>
Specifies list of comma separated attributes for which a drop-down filter is displayed
in the search result page. By selecting a value from that drop-down box, only entries
with that value are displayed. In addition to all attributes defined in the
<b><code>Attributes =</code></b> list, the attribute <b><code>Date</code></b> can be
listed here to display a date filter. Using that filter, the last day, week, month and so
on can be displayed.
<p>

</UL>

<a name="access"><hr>
<div class=section>&nbsp; Access control &nbsp;</div>
<p>
Reading and writing into logbooks can be constrained using two different access methods,
either with global passwords for read, write and admin (config, delete), or with user-
level passwords. Both methods can be combined on the same server using different logbooks.
For these two schemes to work properly, <b>cookies have to be turned
on in your browser</b>. Please consult your browser documentation about how to do that.
<p>

<UL>
<LI><b><code>Read password = &lt;encoded password&gt;</code></b>
<LI><b><code>Write password = &lt;encoded password&gt;</code></b>
<LI><b><code>Admin password = &lt;encoded password&gt;</code></b>
<LI><b><code>Write password expiration = &lt;hours&gt;</code></b>
<LI><b><code>Admin password expiration = &lt;hours&gt;</code></b>
</ul>
<p>
These optional password statements define passwords for reading and writing to the
logbook, to delete entries in the logbook and to configure a logbook via the <I>Config</I
> menu. The passwords are stored in an encoded form. To change them, use <code><b>elogd
</b></code> directly with the <b><code>-r </code></b>, <b><code>-w</code></b> and <b>
<code>-a </code></b> flags. To set the write password of logbook "<I>linux</I>" to "<I>
test</I>", enter: <p>
<ul><code>elogd -w test -l linux</code></ul><p>

The read password is queried by the browser with a pop-up window and usually stays
active for the entire browser session. The write and admin passwords are stored in
cookies on the browser side and expire after the browser session. This time can be
changed with the statement <b> <code>Write Password Expiration = x</code></b> or <b>
<code>Admin Password Expiration = x</code></b>, where <i>x</i> is the expiration time in
hours. It should be noted that on some systems the daylight savings time is calculated
incorrectly, which can cause time offsets of one hour between a server PC and a client
PC. In this case one hour must be added to the expiration time. If the expiration is set
to "0", which is the default, the passwords are kept for the current browser session
only. When the browser is restarted, the password must be re-entered.<P>

<ul>
<LI><b><code>Password file = &lt;file&gt;</code></b>
<LI><b><code>Login expiration = &lt;hours&gt;</code></b>
<LI><b><code>Admin user = &lt;user list&gt;</code></b>
<LI><b><code>Login user = &lt;user list&gt;</code></b>
</ul>
<p>
An alternative to the read/write/admin passwords is the user level access with a
password file. This file contains user names and passwords in following format:
<p>
<ul><code><pre>&lt;login name1&gt;:&lt;password1&gt;:&lt;full name1&gt;:&lt;email1&gt;:&lt;notify1&gt;
&lt;login name2&gt;:&lt;password2&gt;:&lt;full name2&gt;:&lt;email2&gt;:&lt;notify2&gt;
&lt;login name3&gt;:&lt;password3&gt;:&lt;full name3&gt;:&lt;email3&gt;:&lt;notify3&gt;
...</pre></code></ul>
<p>

The passwords are encoded. New users can either be created by hitting <b>Register as new user</b>
on the login page if <b><code>Self register = 1</code></b> in the configuration file, or
by the admin user in the <b>Config</b> page by pressing <b>New user</b>. When a user is
logged it, the entry for this user can be modified via the <b>Config</b> command.<p>

To start a new password file, follow these steps:

<UL>
<LI>Set <b><code>Self register = 1</b></code> in the configuration file
<LI>Connect to the logbook. You will be presented the login page. If you have a <b><code>
Guest menu commands</b></code> entry, you have to click on "Login" to get that screen.
<LI>Click on "Register as new user"
<LI>Enter your login information and save it
<LI>Add <b><code>Admin user = &lt;user&gt;</code></b> into the configuration file, using
your login name from above
<LI>If you now enter the "Config" page, you can add other users
<LI>Remove the self registration option if you like
</UL>

The presence of a password file requires all users to "<I>log in</I>" using their name and
password, except when a guest login is allowed via the <b>"Guest menu commands"</b> option.
An additional advantage of this method is that the user name can be used as
an attribute value for creating logbook entries. For example, the following line could be
added to the configuration file to fill in the <i>Author</i> and the <i>Email</i> attributes
with the current user name and email:
<p>
<ul><code>Attributes = Author, Email, ...</code></ul>
<ul><code>Subst Author = $long_name from $remote_host<br>
Subst Email = $user_email</code></ul>
<p>
Thus the author name is not user-input anymore, ensuring the entry always contains the
actual user name. For a full listing of substitutions, see the "<I>Subst &lt;attrib></I>" option.<p>

The user name and password are stored as cookies on the user side. They expire after the
current browser session by default, which can be changed with the <code><b>Login
expiration</b></code > option, giving the expiration time in hours. Setting this to 24
for example, makes the password expire after one day.<p>

The <b><code>Admin user = &lt;user list&gt;</b></code> is a list of one or more user names,
which have admin rights. They see a button <b><code>Change elogd.cfg</code></b> on the
config page by which they can edit elogd.cfg through the web. They can also modify other 
users on the <b><code>Config</code></b> page, change their passwords or remove them.<p>

The <b><code>Login user = &lt;user list&gt;</b></code> is a list of users who can
log in to a specific logbook. This option can be used with a global password file. If a
<b><code>Password file</code></b> is present under the <b><code>[global]</b></code>
section, the registered users in that password file can log in to all logbooks. It might
be required that only certain users can log in to certain logbooks. This can be achieved
with the <b><code>Login user</code></b> option, places in each individual logbook
section in the configuration file. Only those users listed in this statement can log in
to the logbook where the statement is defined. This method has the advantage over the
option of definining individual password files for individual logbooks that only one
central password file exists. So if a user changes her/his password, this becomes then
valid for all logbooks. If there would be individual logbook password files, one would 
have to change the password in all logbooks individually.<p>

<ul>
<LI><b><code>Self register = 0|1|2|3</code></b>
</ul>

With this option it is possible for new users to self-register an user account. At the
login page, a link is displayed <b>"Register as a new user"</b> which leads the user to
a configuration page where one can enter the account name, full name and email address.
A flag allows for automatic email notification on new entries on the logbook. These
settings can later be changed with the <b>Config</b> menu command.<p>

Setting this option to <b>0</b> disables self registration. With option <b>1</b>, users
can silently register, while setting it to <b>2</b> causes elogd to send an email
notification to the admin user(s). The option <b>3</b> is used to <i>only</i> send an
email notification to tha admin users(s), which then can validate the account and commit
it by hitting the URL given in the email notification.<p>

<ul>
<LI><b><code>Allow &lt;command&gt; = &lt;user list&gt;</code></b>
</ul>
<p>
Commands can be restricted to certain login names (separated by commas). For
each command in the list defined with the "<I>Menu commands</I>" option, a list of
user names can be specified, which are allowed to execute that command. If the
allow option is not present, all users may execute that command by default.
<p>

<ul>
<LI><b><code>Deny &lt;command&gt; = &lt;user list&gt;</code></b>
</ul>
<p>
Used to deny a certain command to a list of users. This can be used to deny
a guest user to enter new messages or modify a message.
<p>

<ul>
<LI><b><code>Hosts allow = &lt;list&gt;</code></b>
<LI><b><code>Hosts deny = &lt;list&gt;</code></b>
</ul>
<p>
These two settings can be used to restrict the access to the logbook to certain
computers. It is similar to the UNIX <i>hosts.allow</i> and <i>hosts.deny</i> files.
The list can consist of individual host names or IP numbers, subnet masks like
<b><code>123.213.</b></code> (note the trailing '.') or <b><code>.mit.edu</b></code>,
or the word <b><code>All</code></b>. The following rules are applied:
<ul>
<li>Access will be granted when a host matches a pattern in "<I>hosts allow</I>".
<li>Otherwise, access will be denied when a host matches a pattern in "<I>hosts deny</I>".
<li>Otherwise, access will be granted.
</ul>
<p>
These rules are applied <i>before</i> any password is checked. To debug problems,
start <code><b>elogd</b></code> with the "-v" flag, in which case the rule checking is printed
on the screen.
<p>

The global option <code><b>Logfile = &lt;filename&gt;</b></code> can be specified
to log all user login/logout activities plus all successful user connections.<p>

If any of the password statements are in the <b><code>[global]</code></b> area of the
configuration files, they are used for all logbooks. If one logs in at one logbook,
access is automaticlly granted to all logbooks. If the password statements are in the
individual logbook sections, one has to log in to each logbook separately.<p>

<a name="email"><hr>
<div class=section>&nbsp; EMail notification &nbsp;</div>

<ul>
<LI><b><code>Email &lt;attribute&gt; &lt;value&gt; = &lt;list&gt;</code></b>
<LI><b><code>Use Email Subject = &lt;string&gt;</code></b>
<LI><b><code>Use Email From = &lt;string&gt;</code></b>
<LI><b><code>Omit Email To = 0|1</code></b>
<LI><b><code>Suppress Email to users = 0|1</code></b>

</ul>
<p>
To send email automatically when new entries are created in a logbook, a <b><code>SMTP host =
</b></code> entry must be present in the <b><code>[global]</code></b> section
of the configuration file. To submit an email based on an attribute value, use the statement <b><code>Email &lt;attribute&gt; &lt;value&gt; =
&lt;list&gt;</b></code>. Whenever an entry is submitted where <b><code>
attribute</code></b> is equal to <b><code>value</code></b>, an email
notification is sent to the email addresses in <b><code>list</code></b>.
Several mail addresses may be supplied, separated by commas. The mail addresses can
contain attributes via the <b>"$"</b> substitution. If a logbook contains for
example an attribute <i>name</i> which contains email names, then one can
put <i>$name@domain</i> to form a valid email address.<p>

Multiple <b><code>Email xxx</code></b > statements may occur in a configuration
file. If either the attribute or the value contains one or more blanks the string
must be enclosed with quotation marks, as in:
<p>
<ul><code>Email type "Normal routine" = ...</code></ul>
<p>
The statement <b><code>Email All = &lt;list&gt;</code></b> sends an
email notification independent of the type and category. The <b><code>Use
Email Subject = &lt;string&gt;</b></code> statement specifies which text is
used as the email subject. The text can contain <b><code>$&lt;attribute&gt;
</code></b>statements which are substituted with the current value of that
attribute. For a full list of possible substitutions, see the
"<I>Subst &lt;attribute&gt;</I>" option. The option <b><code>Use Email From = &lt;string&gt;
</code></b> is used for the "<I>from</I>" field in the email. If the flag <b><code>
Omit Email To</b></code> is set to <b>1</b>, the <i>To:</i> field in the email is
left empty instead set to the real email address of the recipients. This can
be useful if one recipient should not see the email addresses of the other recipients.
<p>
The flag <b><code>Suppress Email to users</b></code> can be set to <b>"1"</b> if email should
only be sent to the recipients of the <b><code>Email &lt;attribute&gt; &lt;value&gt; = &lt;list&gt;</code></b>
statements but not to the users who have registerd for automatic email notification.<p>

<a name="flags"><hr>
<div class=section>&nbsp; Flags &nbsp;</div>

<ul>
<li><b><code>Show text = 0|1</code></b>
</br>
This flag controls if logbook entries contain a body text. If an installation
only requires attributes, this flag can be set to <b>0</b>. Default is
<b>1</b>.
<p>

<li><b><code>Enable attachments = 0|1</code></b>
</br>
This flag controls the attachment submission at the bottom of a message
entry page. If this flag is <b>0</b>, the attachment section is not displayed.
This might be useful for logbooks where attachments are not used. Default
is <b>1</b>.
<p>

<li><b><code>Show attachments = 0|1</code></b>
</br>
This flag controls the display of attachments such as images on normal
logbook pages. For logbooks with large images, this flag can be turned off,
so that attachments are only displayed when they are clicked on. Default
is <b>1</b>.
<p>

<li><b><code>Summary lines = x</code></b>
</br>
This specifies the number of text lines displayed in a summary page. Zero displays
no text at all. The default is 3.
<p>

<li><b><code>Reverse sort = 0|1</code></b>
</br>
If this flag is <b>1</b>, all listing pages (the default page view, the result of
a search query and the result of the <i>"Last day"</i> query)
is sorted in reverse order (newest entry down to oldest). The checkbox <i>Sort in
reverse order</i> on the search form gets checked by default, too. Sorting in reverse
order can make sense if there are many pages of entries, but the ones entered last
should be displayed on the first page. Default is <b>0</b>.<p>

<li><b><code>Search all logbooks = 0|1</code></b>
</br>
If this flag is <b>1</b>, the search form displays the button <i>"Search all
logbooks"</i>. The default is <b>1</b>. It might be necessary to turn this option
off for public logbooks if there are also protected logbooks. Otherwise the
search result would also display entries from the protected logbooks.<p>

<li><b><code>Enable browsing = 0|1</code></b>
</br>
If this flag is <b>1</b>, browsing (hitting the next/previous button) is enabled.
For some rare occasions it might be necessary to disable browsing. Default is
<b>1</b>.
<p>

<li><b><code>Filtered browsing = 0|1</code></b>
</br>
If this flag is <b>1</b>, browsing (hitting the next/previous button) can be
filtered by individual attributes. If the checkbox next to an attribute is checked,
only messages with the same attribute value are displayed. Default is <b>1</b>.
<p>

<li><b><code>HTML default = 0|1|2|3</code></b>
</br>
This specifies the default state of the "<I>Submit as HTML text</I>" button on the
new message entry from. For installations where entries are normally submitted
as HTML, the default can be set to <b>1</b>. If this value is set to <b>2
</b> or <b>3</b>, the check box is not displayed and only text submissions
ore HTML submissions are possible, respectively. The default is <b>0</b>.
<p>

<li><b><code>Suppress default = 0|1|2</code></b>
</br>
This specifies the default state of the "<I>Suppress Email notification</I>" button on the
new message entry form. For installations where normally an email notification is
not necessary, the default can be set to <b>1</b>. If an important entry is
entered, users can then uncheck the suppress box. If this value is set to <b>2
</b>, the suppress box is not displayed at all, so that an email notification is
always produced. The default is <b>0</b>.
<p>

<li><b><code>Resubmit default = 0|1|2</code></b>
</br>
This specifies the default state of the "<I>Resubmit as new entry</I>" button on the
edit message entry from. If this button is checked, the current message is removed
from its current position in the database and submitted as a new message. This
can for example be useful for applications where users want to see which records
have been updated recently. If this value is set to <b>2</b>, the resubmit box
is not displayed at all. The default is <b>0</b>.
<p>

<li><b><code>Display Email recipients = 0|1</code></b>
</br>
If this flag is <b>1</b>, the email recipients are displayed when a logbook
entry is entered which produces an email notification. Setting this flag to 0
suppresses this display, in case users need not see that email is being sent and to whom.
The default is <b>1</b>.
<p>

<li><b><code>Email message body = 0|1</code></b>
</br>
If this flag is <b>1</b>, the email notification send by elog contains the
full message body in addition to the attributes. The default is <b>0</b>.
<p>

<li><b><code>Suppress Email on edit = 0|1</code></b>
</br>
If this flag is <b>1</b>, no email notifications are sent for edited messages,
only for new messages. The default is <b>0</b>.
<p>

<li><b><code>Back to main = 0|1</code></b>
</br>
If this flag is <b>1</b>, the "<I>Back</I>" button takes you back to the logbook
selection page instead to the last entry of the current logbook.
The default is <b>0</b>.
<p>

<li><b><code>Logout to main = 0|1</code></b>
</br>
If this flag is <b>1</b>, the "<I>Logout</I>" operation takes you back to the logbook
selection page instead to the login page.
The default is <b>0</b>.
<p>

<li><b><code>Restrict edit = 0|1</code></b>
</br>
If this flag is <b>1</b>, users can only edit their own messages. The system
checks automatically if the currently logged in user matches the user
supplied in an author attribute via the <i>"Preset xxxx"</i> option.
The default is <b>0</b>.
<p>

<li><b><code>Expand default = 0|1|2|3</code></b>
</br>
This setting determines how messages are displayed in threaded mode. Following
options are possible:
<ul>
<li><b>0</b>: Only message heads are displayed, no replies. A "+" indicates which message
has one or more replies.
<li><b>1</b>: Messages and replies are displayed, but no message body.
<li><b>2</b>: Messages and replies are displayed together with the first few lines of the
message body. The number of lines is controlled by the <b><code>Summary lines</b></code> option.
<li><b>3</b>: Messages and replies are displayed together with the full message body.
</ul>
The default is <b>1</b>.
<p>

</ul><p>

<a name="themes"><hr>
<div class=section>&nbsp; Themes &nbsp;</div>
<p>
Themes are layout and color schemes which determine the look and feel of a logbook
(sometimes called <i>"skins"</i>). A theme
consists of a set of images, which are used for the title banner and browse buttons, and
a Cascading Style Scheet (CSS), which defines the colors, fonts and spacing of the ELOG pages.
<p>

Each theme resides in a separate subdirectory and is specified with the
<b><code>theme = &lt;dir&gt;</code></b> option in the configuration file. Each theme can
contain several CSSs, which can be selected with the <b><code>CSS = &lt;filename&gt;</code></b>
option.
<p>

A default theme is contained in the distribution. If new themes are developed by users,
they can be sent back to the author, to be included in future releases.
<p>

To change colors and fonts, the source of a ELOG page can be examined. All elements use
CSS classes which are specified in the <b><code>class="&lt;name&gt;"</code></b> statements.
These classes can be found in the <b><code>.../themes/default/default.css</code></b>
file and changed accordingly. For a description of all options, please consult for example the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS1">W3C</a> consortium.<p>

If the CSS file is edited, most browsers require a "reload" to refresh the modified file.
The <B>elogd </B>daemon does not have to be restarted after a change in the DSS file.
<p>
These two images display the same logbook entry using different themes:
