<LI><a name=#1><b>How does one configure elog to display the last message by default</b>
<p>
One can use the <b><code>Start page</code></b> option for that. The entry:<p>
<code>
Start page = 0?cmd=last
</code><p>
shows the last message entry by default. To have the described behaviour for
all logbooks, the above statements can be placed in the <b><code>[global]</code></b> section.
<p>


<LI><a name=#2><b>Are there any plans to implement a MySQL back end?</b>
<p>
No. The idea behind <b>ELOG</b> is that it is a <I>simple to use, simple to install</I> application.
Many people use <b>ELOG</b> under Windows, and they even don't know what MySQL means. Other people like
the flat file database format, because it's simple, easily accessible from other programs, and it's easy
to backup certain days or months of the database (since the filenames contain the date). Since <b>ELOG
</b> should be independent of any other package, some "switchable" backend between native <b>ELOG</b>
format and MySQL would be needed, which is lots of work and not planned right now.<p>

However, there are several contributions from other people who wrote scripts to put ELOG entries
into a MySQL database. One is available at
<a href="http://midas.psi.ch/elogs/Forum/387">http://midas.psi.ch/elogdemo/Forum/387</a>.
<p>

<LI><a name=#3><b>Can I run the ELOG daemon from inside Apache or any other Web server?</b>
<p>
No. The <b>ELOG</b> daemon was designed as a standalone server and it will stay like that in the future.
The reason for that is that <code><b>elogd</b></code> should not rely on any other software. This is for
example important for many people running <code><b>elogd</b></code> under Windows, and they have no clue
how to install Apache for Windows. The installation and maintenance for <code><b>elogd</b></code>
therefore becomes much simpler. To run <code><b>elogd</b></code> in parallel to an Apache server on
port 80, use Apache as a proxy, following the instruction on the installation page
("Running elogd under Apache").<p>

<LI><a name=#4><b>I can access my logbook without any password, isn't that a security problem?</b>

<p> By default, no password is used in <b>ELOG</b>. This can be useful for public directories etc. that
anybody should be able to read. To add password security, read the documentation under <a href=
"config.html#access">Access control</a>. The recommended setup is password file security with
guest access.

<p> Note that passwords are transferred over the network in plain text and therefore not secure. If this
is a problem, a <a href="adminguide.html#secure">secure</a> network connection should be used. <p>

<LI><a name=#5><b>I want a bookmark pointing to the last page where an attribute has a certain value</b>
<p>
Use the URL:
<p>
<code>http://&lt;your.host&gt;/&lt;logbook&gt;/?cmd=Last&&lt;attribute&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</code>
<p>
This executes the "<I>Last</I>" command using a filter with &lt;attribute&gt;=&lt;value&gt;. The following command displays the same page, but also locks the attribute (checks the box next to &lt;attribute&gt;) so that browsing (next, previous, first, last) only shows pages with that attribute value.
<p>
<code>http://&lt;your.host&gt;/&lt;logbook&gt;/?cmd=Last&&lt;attribute&gt;=&lt;value&gt;&l&lt;attribute&gt;=1</code>
<p>
Note the "l" before the second attribute, as in "<I>lAuthor=1</I>".
<p>

<LI><a name=#6><b>I want a logbook with public read access (no password), but restricted write access</b>
<p>
In an old version of the FAQ it has been stated here that one has to use two logbooks pointing to
the same data directory. From Version 2.0.6 on, this can be accomplished much easier by the usage
of the <b>"Guest menu command"</b>. Use a logbook with user level access (password file), and add
menu lists like in the following example to the configuration file:<p>

<code>
Menu commands = New, Edit, Reply, Find, Last 10, Change password, Logout, Help<br>
Guest menu commands = Find, Last 10, Login, Help<br>
</code><p>

If users access the logbook without supplying a user name, they are treated like "guests" and see
the "Guest menu commands", with which one cannot submit or edit logbook entries. If one hits the
"login" button, a user can login with a user name/password and sees the normal menu commands, with
which one can submit new logbook entries.<p>

An optional self registration is possible by specifying<p>

<code>
Self register = 1
</code><p>

in the configuration file. New users can then create their own accounts.<p>

<LI><a name=#7><b>I have many loogbooks with password files, so if I add a user or want to change
a password I have to do this for all logbooks which is painful.</b>
<p>
You can have several logbooks point to the same password file. So if you change a user or
password in that file, it becomes automatically available in all logbooks which use that file.
<p>

<LI><a name=#8><b>How can I configure ELOG such that it displays something else than the message list by default?</b>
<p>
There is a simple trick. You use the <b>"<I>Start page</I>"</b> option in the <code><b>elogd</b></code> file
to redirect the start page to something else. Here are some examples:
<p>
<pre>
?npp=5                                  for the last 5 messages
?last=7                                 show last 7 days (week)
?cmd=New                                show the new message entry form
?cmd=Find                               Show the "find" page
?cmd=Search&amp;&lt;attrib&gt;=&lt;value&gt;            for a search with &lt;attrib&gt;=&lt;value&gt;
</pre>

The various URLs can be copied from the browser's address bar when doint various things there.
<p>

<LI><a name=#9><b>I want to have additional commands specific to my lookbook</b>
<p>
New commands can be added for example with the <b><code>"Bottom text = bottom.html"</b></code> option.
To display all messages from last week and month of with "category = info", one can put
following HTML code in bottom.html:

<pre>
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href="?last=7&Category=Info"&gt;Info from last week&lt;/a&gt; |
&lt;a href="?last=31&Category=Info"&gt;Info from last month&lt;/a&gt; |
&lt;/center>
</pre>
<p>
Note that the parameters <b><code>"last=7&Category=Info"</b></code> applies a filter on the display. You can learn
how to make these filters by looking at the URL in your browser when you submit a find
command with certain options.<p>

<LI><a name=#10><b>How does one configure elog to disable editing of existing messages? I want a logbook where one
can enter messages but not change them afterwards.</b>
<p>
This works with the option <b><code>Menu commands</code></b>. By default, the menu commands <b><code>
Back, New, Edit, Delete, Reply, Find, Config, Help</code></b> are dispalyed and allowed. To avoid
editing (and deleting) of existing messages, one removes the two commands and puts following
statement into <b><code>elogd.cfg</b></code>:
<p>
<code>Menu commands = Back, New, Reply, Find, Config, Help</code>
<p>
This prohibits the execution of the commands "Edit" and "Delete".
<p>

<LI><a name=#11><b>How can I track various revisions of a message using the "edit" command?</b>
<p>
There are two ways:
<p>

<UL>
<LI>Add an attribute which keeps the revision dates and names as follows:
<pre>
Attributes = Author, ..., Revisions
Locked attributes = Revisions
Subst on Edit Revisions = $Revisions&lt;br&gt;$date by $long_name
</pre>

The "Revisions" attribute cannot be modified manually (since it's locked). On each edit, the
date and the current author is appedned to the previous revisions. The "&lt;br&gt;" puts a
line break between the entries.<p>

<LI>Create a thread for each entry. In addition of having the date and author of different
revisions, the message content is kept. To revise and entry, one hits "Reply" instead of "Edit"
(one can disable the "Edit" command for example). If one puts following option into the
configuration file:<p>

<pre>
Reply string = ""
</pre>

then the reply contains the original message without the usual "&gt; " at the beginning of
each line. One can then edit the message and submit it. In the threaded message list display,
one sees then the different revisions as a message thread.<p>
</UL>

<LI><a name=#12><b>How can I enter a date which is different from current one?</b>
<p>
Usually, the current date/time is recorded when you add a new entry. It might be, however,
that one wants to enter "old" entries, or some entries with a date in the future (like a
to-do list with a due date). To do that, on can add a new attribute (let's call it
<i>Record date</i>, to be different from the pre-defined <i>Date</i>:<p>

<code>
Attributes = Author, ..., Record date<br>
Preset Record date = $date<br>
Date format = %Y %m %d<br>
List Display = Record date, Author, ...<br>
Start page = ?rsort=Record date<br>
</code><p>

The <i>Preset Record date</i> statement sets the record date to the current date, but
this can then of course edited during the message entry. The <i>List Display</i> and
<i>Start page</i> statements show the record date as the first column in the summary
display and also sort by that. Note the <i>Date format</i> showing first year, then month
and day. This is necessary since sorting is done only lexically. Please note that the
<i>List Display</i> was renamed recently. Prior to version 2.3.10, it was called
<i>Display Search</i>.
